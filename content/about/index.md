I'm a PhD candidate in physics at University of California, Riverside, working on theoretical condensed matter physics ðŸ¤¯. I'm also excited by quantum computing and interested in understanding why machine learning works so well, from a perspective of statistical physics. 

Being a teaching assistant is a large part of my academic life. Here are some of the courses I've taught:

- Classical Mechanics (undergraduate)
- Electromagnetism (graduate)
- Quantum Mechanics (undergraduate & graduate)
- Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (graduate)
