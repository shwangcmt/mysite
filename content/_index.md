Welcome! ðŸŽ‰ The main purpose of this website is to collect and share my thoughts about physics, while serving as a teaching assistant for several courses in physics at both undergraduate and graduate levels. I love teaching, which helps me learn way more effectively. 

You can find all my posts on the [Blog]({{< ref "posts/_index.md" >}}) page. They are also grouped by [Topics]({{< ref "topics" >}}) and [Tags]({{< ref "tags" >}}). At the top-right corner, a search button and a light/dark toggle are available. 

In case you're interested, take a look at my [Research]({{< ref "projects/index.md" >}}). To learn more about me and find my contact information, see [About]({{< ref "about/index.md" >}}).
